\section{Problem Analysis}
\par
In order to achieve such a complex project, a plan had to be made. The problem was broken into two steps, the first was designing the software, the second was then fitting the hardware together.
The first question devised was: ``Can we make a toy car drive around, and prevent the user from crashing it into objects''?


Given the fact that the expected scope of the project is relatively small, and the limited amount of time that was available, it was concluded to be best to simplify the problem. Designing and printing the body, as well as designing an anti-crash system on top of designing an app and communications system between three devices seemed infeasible. Thus the second question devised was: ``Can we mod or hack an RC car such that we can control it over wifi''? This was decided to be possible with the resources that were available.
