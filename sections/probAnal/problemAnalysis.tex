\section{Problem Analysis}
\par
In order to get the project off the ground, we started with making a plan. Our plan would consist of two parts, designing the code and the hardware

Can we make a toy car drive around, avoiding obstacles automatically?

Given the fact that our current project is relatively small, and the limited amount of time that we have for this, we concluded it best to simplify our problem as follows:

Can we mod or hack an RC car such that we can control it over wifi?

This would allow us a proof of concept which could be expanded when we have any remaining time. If time remained, we could add the following features:

 - Obstacle detection
 - Camera feedback
 - Different body
 - Accelerometer to check if we've actually hit something
